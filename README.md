# Custom Made DIY Joystick

This personal project has the design files I will be using to create my own DIY custom built joystick.

The stick will use a [Raspbery Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) as a controller. It will also use the PCB design from the [Pico Fighting Board](https://github.com/FeralAI/PicoFightingBoard) project.

The base design is coming from a standard joystick and button layout found on a SEGA machine (courtesy of [Slagcoin](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick.html)). I'll be modifying that design to adjust for my hand size and shoulder width.
